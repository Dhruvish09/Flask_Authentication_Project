Setting up Flask Authentication Project

Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

    # Create a new directory for your project (if not already created)
    mkdir flask_authentication_project
    cd flask_authentication_project

    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

Step 2: Install Requirements

    # Make sure you are in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated
    # Install required Python packages
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configure Database

    Create a new schema in your database and add its connection details to the .env file.

    EX:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql+pymysql://root:root@localhost/flask_auth

Step 4: Migrate Database

    # Initialize the database migration
    flask db init

    # Create a migration script
    flask db migrate

    # Apply the migration to the database
    flask db upgrade

Step 5: Start API Checking

    Ensure that your Flask application is running.
    Use the provided Postman collection link to test the API endpoints.

Forgot Password Functionality::::-

Implemented two methods:

(1)API reset password:

Users can initiate password reset by providing their email via API request.
Upon request, an email containing a reset link is sent to the user's email address.
The link includes a token for password reset.

(2)Direct Template reset password:

Users can access a password reset template directly via URL with the provided token.
This route renders the template where users can input their new password.





OTP Login Functionality::::-

Utilizing Twilio for seamless authentication:

API Endpoint (/signin_with_otp):

Users provide their phone number and receive an OTP via SMS.
Upon receiving the OTP, users enter it along with their phone number for authentication.
If the OTP is valid, users are granted access to their account.
Twilio Integration:

Twilio's SMS service is integrated into the application for sending OTPs securely.
Twilio API facilitates the delivery of OTPs to users' phone numbers in real-time.
This integration ensures reliable and efficient OTP-based authentication for users.
